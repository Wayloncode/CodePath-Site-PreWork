Submitted by: **Waylon Zhu**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission outside of the resources already provided to me.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was trying to understand how to write the functions in the script.js to get the game working. I hard a hard time understanding the instructions as they would tell me to do something. The instructions would sometimes give my snippets of code that I had to add in but I sometimes struggled with figuring out where to put the snippet. In addition, sometimes the instructions would ask me to copy an existing snippet and modify it so that it would do a different task. Overall, it was challenging not know how to program in javascript but I was able to overcome this issue by reading the lengthy explanations on the handout when you click the drop down menu. I also used trial and error for one part where I was asked to finish writing a function without using snippets of code. I persisted through it by looking at the snippets of code that I added in from the handout and trying to understand what each part does and how they play a part in the program. The drop down information on the handout also helped by explaining what each part of a snippet did for some of the snippets.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing my submission, some questions I have about web development are how everything is done and brought together. What I mean by that is, how do programmers decide where to start on first on more complicated programs. In this project, we used html, javascript, and css together. How would programmers decide where to start coding first? Do they start with html like this project did or do they make javascript first? I came into this project not knowing how to do html, javascript, or css so I was wondering how programmers decide which is better to start on first and how they go about planning how to finish writing the rest of the program.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them refactoring certain functions to incorporate the additional optional features. I would add functions to make a clock that ticks. I would also refactor some functions to so that the pattern is completely random and that the light and sounds would show less and the pattern would play faster. In addition, I think it would be nice to add some images and if possible (if I'm able to do this) mix and match the buttons around to different positions but keep the colors and sound.
